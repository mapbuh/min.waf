- include something like https://github.com/bitwire-it/ipblocklist?tab=readme-ov-file
 (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitwire-it/ipblocklist/refs/heads/main/ip-list.txt)
- catch signals - graceful stop, reread conf on hup, dump stats on usr1
- use captcha instead of blocking
- remove tools, use command parameter
- organize in folders, move ip_blacklist.txt somewhere
